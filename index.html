<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implemented a 2D fluid simulation using Threejs and WebGL. 
	Our simulator is based on the Navier Stokes equations and utilizes a 2D grid of 
	attributes that determine the movement of particles within the grid. 
	Using WebGL, we perform the relevant calculations using a set of fragment shaders 
	that encode the various attributes and manipulate their values.
	We also implemented interactivity allowing the user to create new forces to affect 
	the fluid flow, construct barriers to block flow, and switch between different 
	visualizations of the particles and attribute fields. 
	The resulting simulation is capable of running on most modern browsers and can 
	be seen <a href="/fluid_collision_sim/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
<h3 align="middle">Preface</h3>
<p>
	Our approach was based on the implementation described in 
	<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-vi-beyond-triangles/chapter-38-fast-fluid-dynamics-simulation-gpu">Nvidia Developer Chapter 38</a>,
	which we used as a reference for implementing the Navier-Stokes calculations. 
	We also created a particle simulation on top of the 2D attribute grid to better display 
	the movement of the fluid<!--TODO: Ref?-->, as well as internal boundary conditions to allow for user 
	drawn barriers<!--TODO: Ref?-->. 
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle">Navier Stokes Equations</h3>
<p>
	Our fluid simulation is based on the Navier Stokes equations and assume an incompressible homogenous fluid.
	The Navier Stokes equations (for an incompressible fluid) are as follows:
	<br>
	$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -(u \cdot \nabla)u - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + v \nabla^2 u + F$$
	$$\nabla \cdot u = 0$$
	<br>
	Where u represents the flow velocity, p represents pressure, v represents viscosity, and 
	F is the effect of external forces, which in our simulation, is the user mouse click. 
	Looking at each term, we have Variation = Advection - Pressure + Diffusion + External Forces. 
	<br>
	To calculate the effects of the Navier Stokes equations, we took each term and had a 
	different shader perform the calculations by storing the results to a texture map. Thus, 
	we had a shader for advection, one for pressure, one for diffusion, as well as a few 
	shaders for intermediate calculations such as jacobi iteration.
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle"> Project Framework</h3>
<p>
	Our simulator is built in Javascript using Three.js, which allows us to utilize WebGL 
	to perform calculations and draw 3D (but we only use 2D) graphics to the screen. 
	For each of the attributes that are able to be visualized (velocity, divergence, and pressure), 
	we have an <c1>AttributeField</c1> class which contains WebGLRenderTarget buffers  
	that we have the shaders read and write to in order to update the parameters. Because we cannot read 
	and write to the same buffer at once, we have a specific read and write buffer 
	and switch them after each update. Within our main simulation loop, we 
	repeatedly pass these <c1>AttributeField</c1> buffer textures' buffers to the respective calculation shaders 
	and have them perform one of the calculations required to complete one timestep update, then draw the results to the screen. 
</p>
<p>
	We also implemented shaders to handle the movement of randomly placed particles, which 
	are advected (at least visually) through the fluid by forward integration using the velocity
	vector field (We use a basic euler step to achieve this). Finally, we implemented user interactivity 
	by tracking the position of the mouse and whether it is pressed or not, and adding external forces or 
	boundary cells to the area that the mouse drags over. 
</p>
<p>
	The settings menu was created with dat.gui as a lightweight and low complexity user 
	interface that allowed us to focus more development on the actual simulator. 
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle">Shaders</h3>
<h4 align="middle">Advection</h4>
<p>
	Advection is the process of a fluid transporting itself. For our 2D grid of 
	attributes, we represent this as updating a grid cell to a new velocity given 
	its previous velocity. This is calculated using an implicit method (Stam 1999) 
	that is stable for arbitrary timesteps and velocities.
	$$q(x, t + \delta t) = q(x - u(x, t) \delta t, t)$$
	where q is the updated fluid property (velocity in our case), u(x, t) is the 
	original value of the fluid property, x is the cell position, and 
	t is the timestep (which we fix to 1.0 for our implementation).

</p>
<br>

<h4 align="middle">Divergence</h4>
<p>
	Divergence measures the change in velocity across a surface surrounding a 
	small area of fluid. We then update the velocity field according to the 
	following formula:
	$$\nabla \cdot u = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta v}{\delta y} 
	= \frac{u_{i+1, j} - u_{i-1, j}}{2\delta x} + \frac{v_{i, j+1} - v_{i, j-1}}{2\delta y}$$
	where u and v are parameters of the velocity field u = (u, v).

</p>
<br>

<h4 align="middle">Jacobi Iteration</h4>
<p>
	Jacobi iteration is an iterative technique that converges towards a solution for a 
	system of linear equations. We use it here to solve poisson equations, which include 
	the pressure field and the viscosity term. 
	$$x_{i, j}^{k+1} = \frac{x_{i-1, j}^k + x_{i+1, j}^k + x_{i, j-1}^k + x_{i, j+1}^k + \alpha b_{i, j}}{\beta}$$
	where x is the field (pressure or velocity), b is the divergence, alpha and beta are constants.
</p>
<br>

<h4 align="middle">Gradient Subtraction</h4>
<p>
	To ensure that we have an incompressible fluid (which means divergence is 0 by Navier Stokes), we subtract 
	the pressure gradient from the velocity field.
	$$u = w - \nabla p$$
	Combining divergence, the poisson pressure distribution, 
	and gradient subtraction gives us the pressure term in the Navier Stokes equation, which describes 
	projection of the fluid from high pressure to low pressure areas.
</p>
<br>

<h4 align="middle">External Forces</h4>
<p>
	When the user clicks their mouse and drags, we generate a force that is added to the velocity 
	field in the direction of the drag. This follows the following formula:
	$$c = F \delta t \frac{(x - x_p)^2 + (y-y_p)^2}{r}
	$$
	where c is the representation of force to add to the velocity field, F is the force 
	computed from the mouse drag, and (x, y) and (xp, yp) are the cell position and click position. 
	We see that the large fraction is simply distance over radius, so that the cells closest to 
	the mouse have the greatest increase.
</p>
<br>

<h4 align="middle">Boundaries</h4>
<p>
	In order to implement boundaries, we needed to enforce no-slip velocity boundary conditions and pure 
	Neumann pressure boundary conditions after modifying the <c1>velocityField</c1> and <c1>pressureField</c1>. 
	Within the other shader programs it is assumed that every grid cell lies within the fluid domain. The
	boundary shader programs adjust the velocities and pressure values acquired through the simulation process 
	to take into account the existence of grid cells that lie in the boundary domain.
</p>
<p>
	No-slip velocity boundary conditions are applied differently depending on the type of boundary cell we are dealing
	with. The first type is a boundary cell that borders only one fluid cell. 
</p>
<p>
	For example, in the case of a boundary cell <c1>B_W</c1> located at cell (i,j) with a fluid cell to its left in 
	cell (i-1,j), we set the velocity of the boundary cell to the negated velocity of its fluid cell neighbor, 
	following this constraint equation:
</p>
<p>
	$$\frac{u_{i-1 , j} - u_{i , j}}{2}$$
</p>
<p>
	To enforce pure Neumann pressure boundary conditions, we set the pressure value of a boundary cell to the pressure 
	value of its fluid cell neighbor, following this constraint equation:
</p>
<p>
	$$\frac{p_{i-1 , j} - p_{i , j}}{\delta x}$$
</p>
<p>
	In the case where a boundary cell borders multiple fluid cells, we simply set the boundary velocity to the negated 
	average of all its neighboring fluid cell velocities. For a boundary cell <c1>B_NE</c1> with neigboring fluid cells in its 
	north and east directions, the boundary velocity <i><m1>u<sub>i,j</sub></m1></i> is computed as such:
</p>
<p>
	$$u_{i, j} = -\frac{u_{i, j+1} + u_{i+1, j}}{2} $$
</p>
<p>
	Pressure values are calculated in the same way, except the average value is not negated

<br>

<h4 align="middle">Particles</h4>
<p>
	There are three main shaders used for simulating and rendering particles with the trail effect. The particle simulation 
	shader is purely for simulating the movement of the particles. It takes in a texture buffer of particle positions, as well 
	as the <c1>velocityField</c1>, and calculates new positions using forward integration, storing them in a new WebGLRenderTarget.  
	Essentially we are moving the particles according to where they sit on top of the velocity vector field. (NOTE: The resolution 
	of the particle positions texture is <c1>particle_span</c1> x <c1>particle_span</c1>, where <c1>particle_span</c1> equals 
	the square root of the number of particles)
</p>
<p>
	The particle aging shader keeps track of and increment each particles age in a particle age texture and is the same resolution as the 
	particle positions texture. This ensures that any texture coordinate <m1>(<sub> </sub>u, v<sub> </sub>)</m1> corresponds 
	to only one position and one age. When a particle reaches its max lifespan (We used 100 timesteps) it is returned to its 
	initial position. This keeps the particles from moving offscreen.
</p>
<p>
	The particle rendering shader takes in the particle positions and renders them to a canvas texture which is used later 
	during the final render to the screen. To achieve the trailing effect, a semi transparent plane is rendered on top of the 
	particles at every timestep (We use an opacity of <c1>0.01</c1>).
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Problems Encountered</h2>
<p>
    We encountered a problem after implementing particles and some of the basic computational steps for a very basic fluid simulation where we could interact with our cursor to move the fluid around, but the movement and velocity would not propagate through regions of the fluid that had not been interacted with yet. To address this, we added the ability to change the display to the different results of the shaders and compared the results to the results of another known working fluid simulator. It was through this that we found out that the pressure layer was not being calculated properly since interacting with the cursor would not make any change to the layer at all. After pouring over the code, we eventually stumbled upon the source of the problems: we had capitalized a variable incorrectly, causing it to reference some garbage value. After correcting this variable name, the simulator started propagating velocity through the fluid, allowing any disturbances from the user to spread out across the screen.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Lessons</h2>
<p>
    Some lessons learned include how to use the GPU to perform lots of calculations in parallel provided so long as you manipulate the data in a manner that the GPU can handle, in our case, through the use of shaders. We also learned how to use WebGL from using Three.js to manipulate said shaders.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Results</h2>
<p>
	In the final simulation, the user can generate forces to affect the velocity of the 
	fluid, and construct barriers to impede the flow in real time. The user can also utilize 
	the settings menu to visualize different aspects of the fluid.
	<br><br>
	To generate a force, construct a barrier, or erase a barrier, switch the "input mode" dropdown 
	to the respective mode and click and drag on the screen. To reset the fluid velocity or clear 
	all boundaries drawn, check and uncheck the respective boxes.
